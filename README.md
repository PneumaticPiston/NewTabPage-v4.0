# Chromium Extension Template

This is a minimal template for starting a Chromium extension project.

## Structure
- `manifest.json`: Extension manifest
- `src/background.js`: Background script
- `src/content.js`: Content script
- `public/popup.html`: Popup UI

## Getting Started
1. Load this folder as an unpacked extension in Chromium-based browsers.
2. Replace placeholder code with your extension logic.
